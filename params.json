Basic definitions:\r\n\r\nAn image defined in the “real world” is considered to be a function of two real variables, for example, a(x,y) with a as the amplitude (e.g. brightness) of the image at the real coordinate position (x,y).\r\n\r\nHere I tried to implement some basic algorithm of image processing using Java. if you like, you can use this source for your further study or any use.\r\n\r\nto clone this repository follow the commands given below - \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_directory\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:rokon12/image-processing.git\r\n```\r\nhere I have implemented the following algorithms -\r\n\r\n1. Negative\r\n1. Grayscale\r\n1. Histogram Equalize\r\n1. Point Detect\r\n1. Edge Detect\r\n1. Corner Detect\r\n1. Boundary Extract & Compare\r\n"}
